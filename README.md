# keravis

keravis is a high-level API for ConvNet visualizations in Keras. As of v1.0, it supports visualizations of

1. Convolutional layer activations
2. 2-dimensional feature space representations
3. Saliency maps (vanilla backprop, guided backprop, and occlusion)
4. Synthetic maximally-activating images of classifier output
5. Maximally activating patches of an intermediate neuron in a set of images

with support for nested pretrained models.
